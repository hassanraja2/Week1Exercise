# Week1Exercise

What was the challenge?
The challenge was to write a script which  creates a user and group and it assigns the user to the group. Then we had to create another script within the script which writes an echo command and we have to assign th permission to group members to exceute the file. Finally, we had to run the script from run.sh file. 

How I expected the challenge to go?
Before I started the challenge I panicked because I though it will be a difficult task but as I went through it, I've learned problem solving skills. 


What went well?
The skils and knowledge learned through the QA Academy classes  enabled me to to gain foundation knowledge of Linux and Github, which helped me to perform the challenge. Most importantly, I have developed my problem solving skills. 

What didn't go as planned?
During the challenge I felt that I didn't know how to write some commands but then using the resources such as QA community and Google, I was able to tackle the problemn. 


Possible Impovements?
I would like to practice Linux and scripts more so that I become more confortable with them.
